# NLP-course-work
Course work on NLP. On the topic "Research and development of deep neural networks for solving problems of cluster analysis of texts".
In this paper, I studied the architecture of attention and transformer. I also studied BERT and USE and created their ensemble for cluster analysis of texts.
